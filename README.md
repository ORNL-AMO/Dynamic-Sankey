# Dynamic-Sankey

## Description:

A Sankey Diagram is often used to show flow through a system.
Currently, the Sankey Diagram takes inputs through the input boxes
associated with each arrow. From there, the Sankey Diagram should 
detect changes and re-adjust itself to reflect those changes.
The colored gradient of the Sankey also reflect the flow 
through the system.

## Notes
*Currently Sankey Diagram is only ment to operate on **furnaces***  
* Should one want to change this changing the code is needed. (specifically the embeded JSON part)
