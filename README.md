# Dynamic-Sankey [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/ORNL-AMO/Dynamic-Sankey/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)

A dynamic Sankey diagram based on D3.

## Description:

A Sankey Diagram is often used to show flow through a system.
Currently, the Sankey Diagram takes inputs through the input boxes
associated with each arrow. From there, the Sankey Diagram should 
detect changes and re-adjust itself to reflect those changes.
The colored gradient of the Sankey also reflect the flow 
through the system. 

## Installation:
Run `npm install`  

Open sankey.html located in the demos folder.

## Notes
*Currently this Sankey diagram is only ment to operate on **furnaces***  
* Should one want to change this, changes in the code are needed (specifically the embeded JSON part).
